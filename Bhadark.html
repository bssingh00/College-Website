                <h2>ABOUT OUR COLLEGE</h2>
                <p>Bhadrak is one of the thirty districts of the State of Orissa with the geographical area of 2787.9 sq. kms. Formerly it was a Sub-Division of undivided Balasore District. It has got the status of a district since 1 st April 1993. Bhadrak is a north-eastern district of Orissa surrounded by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the districts of Kendrapada and Jajpur in the South, Keonjhar in the West and Balasore in the North. It is believed to be named after the famous Goddess 'Maa Bhadrakali' which is worshiped in a mediaeval temple in the outskirts of Bhadrak town, the head quarters of the district. Bhadrak is also famous for the 'Lord Akhandalamani' worshipped at Aradi about 37 kms. east of the town. Two major rivers 'Baitarani' and 'Salandi' enriched the soil of the district. Some small rivers and tributaries also flow in the district having significant influence in the economic life of the people of the district. The district is primarily agrarian.

 

                    Bhadrak College was established on 6th July, 1948 in Bhadrak town with  the initiative of some benevolent personalities like Dr. Harekrushna Mahatab, a noted politician, ex-Chief Minister of Orissa and ex-Governor of Maharastra, Narendra Prasad Das, a lawyer of repute, Chhakadi Mohanty, an eminent resident of the nereby village Jagannathpur, Mr. Sirajuddin, a well - known mines owner and a host of others. With a modest yet confident beginning, the College has traversed a long way. At first, the college was affiliated to Utkal University for Intermediate Arts only. Intermediate Science classes were started in 1954 - 55. Degree courses in Humanities and Science were introduced in 1951 and 1960-61 respectively.
                    
                     
                    
                    The college entered upon a new phase of development after remaining under the private management for a long period of twenty-three years. It was taken over by the state Govt. in the year 1971. Under Govt. management it is  making headway in all directions. At present the college has 22 departments and imparts Honours teaching in as many as 20 subjects, such as English, Economics, Commerce, History, Political Science, Education, Psychology, Home Science, Sociology, Philosophy, Oriya, Sanskrit, Hindi, Urdu, Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology and Computer Science. Computer Science Honours is the only Self - financing subject available in the college. With the opening of P.G. classes in various subjects such as Economics (1979), Commerce (1985), Urdu (1990), English and Chemistry (1993) and Political Science (1994), the college has carved out a niche for itself in the academic echelons of the state. Conferment of autonomy in 2002 opened up new opportunities and challenges and the college rose to the occasion by capitalizing on the benefits of the autonomy.
                    
                    
                    The college provides Joint Venture computer Education programme in collaboration with 'Computer point' for the bona fide students of the college. It also has IGNOU study centre, which started functioning in 1999. It otters programmes like BOP, PGORO, CIC, CES, CTE, ONHE, etc. The courses are available to the public and students as well.</p>
